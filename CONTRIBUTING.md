## Getting Started

1. **Fork the repository**
   - Visit [Analog repository](https://github.com/jeanmeijer/analog)
   - Click the "Fork" button in the top right
   - Clone your fork locally:

     ```bash
     git clone https://github.com/YOUR-USERNAME/analog.git
     cd analog
     ```

   - Add upstream remote:

     ```bash
     git remote add upstream https://github.com/jeanmeijer/analog.git
     ```

2. **Install dependencies**:

   ```bash
   bun install
   ```

3. **Configure environment variables**:
   Copy the example environment file:

   ```bash
   cp .env.example .env
   ```

   Then, open the newly created `.env` file. You will find default values for `DATABASE_URL` and `BETTER_AUTH_URL`. You need to set the following:
   - `BETTER_AUTH_SECRET`: Generate a secure secret by running `openssl rand -hex 32` in your terminal.
   - `GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID` and `GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET`:
     1. Create a Google project in the [Google Cloud Console](https://console.cloud.google.com/).
     2. Follow [step 1 in the Better Auth documentation](https://www.better-auth.com/docs/authentication/google) to set up Google OAuth credentials.
     3. Enable the Google Calendar API by visiting [Google Cloud Console APIs](https://console.cloud.google.com/apis/library/calendar-json.googleapis.com) and enabling it for your project.
   - `MICROSOFT_CLIENT_ID` and `MICROSOFT_CLIENT_SECRET`:
      1. Go to the [Microsoft Azure Portal](https://portal.azure.com/), then navigate to Microsoft Entra ID → App registrations.
      2. Register a new application and set the redirect URI (`http://localhost:3000/api/auth/callback/microsoft`).
      3. Copy the Application (client) ID and create a new client secret under Certificates & secrets.
      4. Go to API permissions, click + Add a permission, choose Microsoft Graph → Delegated permissions, and add:
          - `Calendars.Read`, `Calendars.ReadWrite`, `User.Read`, `offline_access`


4. **Initialize the application**

   ```bash
   # Run database migrations
   bun run db:migrate

   # Start development server
   bun run dev
   ```
